Applies to these systems:
  * Sun running SunOS"
  * Some other sequential machine running UNIX"
  * Sequent Balance running DYNIX"
  * Alliant FX series running Concentrix"
  * Encore Multimax running Umax"
  * Sequent Symmetry running DYNIX
  * Cray X-MP or Y-MP running UNICOS
  * Cray 2 running UNICOS
  * SGI running IRIX
  * IBM RS6000 running AIX

This distribution contains compiler and run-time library software for
executing SISAL programs on the machines/operating systems listed above.
Specifically, this compiler accepts SISAL source (.sis files) or 
the intermediate form produced by the frontend for SISAL (.if1 files).
The included software consists of:

--osc, a SISAL compiler that accepts .sis or .if1 files (invoking the frontend,
  to produce the .if1 files), invokes machine independent IF1 
  and IF2 optimizers to improve code quality, invokes the "middle end" to 
  produce C, and finally invokes cc to turn the C into executable code.
  
  Osc also accepts .c and .s files generated from earlier executions of osc.
  
--A run time support library for SISAL programs.  It supports array
  operations, storage management and parallel execution.
  On a Sequent Balance, you may choose to install this software to work
  with "gang scheduling" software that is available from another
  source--see below.  Osc relies on this library during loading.
  The library is written entirely in C (NO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PRESENT!),
  but is UNIX dependent (gettimeofday, getrusage (or times), etc.).

--A utility program for running on different numbers of processors 
  to generate speedup curves.
  
--Man pages for osc and its utilities.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

1. Read the software from tape onto the disk of the host machine
   using tar.  We use the term PATH for the complete directory
   name into which you have read this software.

2. Move to PATH, and enter "sh sinstall".  This interactive
   script will produce the Makefile after asking some questions.
   When Makefile is built, you should examine at least the first
   part of it to make sure that the right things will happen.

3. Once you've built PATH/Makefile, you're ready to install.
   If you have the power to write into the directories you specified
   for executables and man pages:
   a) Enter "make all >& LOGFILE".
   b) Examine LOGFILE for errors.

   If you do not have the power to write in the installation and man
   page directories, as is usually the case for "/usr/local/bin" and
   "/usr/man/manl", do this instead:

   a) Enter "make local >& LOGFILE".
   b) Examine LOGFILE for errors.
   c) Find a SUPER USER to execute the following: "make install >& LOGFILE".
   d) Again examine LOGFILE for errors.

4. Now the directory PATH has subdirectories with these contents:

   Frontend --All SISAL to IF1 compilation source files
   Backend  --All IF1 to native code compilation source files
   Runtime  --All runtime source files
   Tools    --Support Utilities
   Man/manl --A possible home for man pages after installation
   bin      --A possible home for executables, runtime library, and .h files
              after installation
   
To obtain a man page, you can use
     psroff -man -Pprinter mandirectory/manfile.l
for the paper version, or
     nroff -man mandirectory/manfile.l
to see it on your terminal.  In the above, "printer" is the name of
the printer where the man page will appear, "mandirectory" is the path
you specified for the man page directory, and "manfile" is the command
whose man page you need.
